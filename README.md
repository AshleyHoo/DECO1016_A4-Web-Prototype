# DECO1016-Web-Prototype

In the final assessment task, you will implement your proposal as an interactive web prototype using the techniques and technologies introduced in the tutorials.

The prototype should take the form of a published website front end, i.e. it should demonstrate the entire user interface of your web application but does not have to be technically fully functional (for example you are not expected to write data into a database). You are also required to submit a design report that contains screenshots of your web prototype and further reflections on any design changes and iterations you have made based on feedback.

background research is irrelevant, also consider accuracy. For example; you stated that the double confirmation of an email address is wrong,however it is a common design validation technique to reconfir an email address. More detail in your user profile would have been beneficial. Great annotations throughout your report. Some of the elements you have included in your design are no needed. The social links and the about us, community and contact page are beyond the scope for this assignment, you primary focus should be on the on-boarding process.
