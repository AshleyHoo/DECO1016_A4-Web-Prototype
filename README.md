# DECO1016-Web-Prototype

In the final assessment task, you will implement your proposal as an interactive web prototype using the techniques and technologies introduced in the tutorials.

The prototype should take the form of a published website front end, i.e. it should demonstrate the entire user interface of your web application but does not have to be technically fully functional (for example you are not expected to write data into a database). You are also required to submit a design report that contains screenshots of your web prototype and further reflections on any design changes and iterations you have made based on feedback.
